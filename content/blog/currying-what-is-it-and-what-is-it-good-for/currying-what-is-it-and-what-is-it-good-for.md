#### Introduction

Functional programming is a very intruiging paradigm for me. Some of the concepts I am already using regularly, especially when writing React or NodeJS code, such as declarative programming, pure functions and higher order functions.

However, there are also concepts that I find a bit hard to grasp. _Currying_, for example, so I decided to learn this by trying it out and while doing that, writing about it.

When reading or watching videos about currying, as is the case with many programming concepts by the way, I notice they immediately dive in how to do it, without explaining why, and what the problem is we are trying to solve.

So what I will do instead is introduce a use case, solve it how most developers would probably do and then show how we could also solve it with currying.

5. Laten zien dat de function nog steeds 3 parameters heeft en dat je hem nu gewoon en curried kunt gebruiken
