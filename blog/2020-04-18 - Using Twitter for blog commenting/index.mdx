Many blogs offer the opportunity to comment on blog posts within the blog site itself. However, I think it's better to use Twitter for this.

My workflow for using Twitter as my commenting platform is as follows:

**Step 1 - Write and share your blog post**

First, I write a blog post (duh). Then, I share that post to Twitter. You can do this by hand by typing a tweet, but better is to add a "Share on Twitter" link to your blog post:

```
https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=YOUR%20TEXT%20HERE&url=https://URL_TO_YOUR_BLOG_POST_HERE&via=YOUR_TWITTER_HANDLE
```

> Note that all CAPITALIZED_PLACEHOLDERS in the URL need to be replaced by your specific texts, URL, name etc.

To share your blog post, you press the link yourself, and voila, a tweet is posted so you let the world know you wrote another awesome blog post.

And the nice thing is that everyone else who is reading your blog post can also click that same link and promote your blog post too! ðŸ’¯

**Step 2 - Comment on your blog via Twitter**

Now that your blog post is live you want readers to be able to comment on it and start a lively discussion. Let's use Twitter for that, because it's something Twitter is good at.

Navigate to the following URL:

https://twitter.com/search?q=https://URL_TO_YOUR_BLOG_POST

And you'll see the tweet you've just posted in step 1. This URL is a search query on Twitter for the URL of your blog post.

Now add this link to your blog post too and name it "Discuss on Twitter". When someone clicks the link and replies to one of the tweets in the search result, that reply will also appear in that search result and this way your are building a discussion thread on your blog post.
