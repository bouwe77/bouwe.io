it's time for evaluating my experience.</p>
<p>It's a new experience for me to blog about programming and I love it. Yesterday
I blogged about the <a href="https://bouwe.io/day-4-render-props">render props pattern</a>.
In one day I not only learned the basics of this pattern but I also blogged
about what I learned. I am sure I will continue doing this as it is a great way
to learn and solidify new things.</p>
<p>However, the 100 Days of Code challenge is, well, challenging. As I said before,
I code almost every day, so the only thing I have to do now is write about it.
But that takes quite some time. Maybe my blog post are too long... ðŸ˜ŠAnd too
detailed perhaps, but that's what I want. And also, having to write every day
feels like an obligation and I don't want too many obligations.</p>
<p>So that's why I decided to quit the challenge, but to keep on blogging. Writing
a blog 2 or 3 times a week is also fine I think.</p>
